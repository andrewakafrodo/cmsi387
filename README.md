CMSI 387: Operating Systems
===========================

This is a repository for the code I wrote during my spring semester in 2013 for the class titled Operating Systems.

The `.pdf` of the syllabus is also uploaded here but for easiness, I have included the most important information in this `README.md`.

### Objectives and Outcomes

This course explores the computer science subfield of operating systems. A computer’s operating system is its “program that runs all other programs”—it is a very special type of program, however, and so it is grounded in common concepts, theories, and algorithms. Long after the course concludes, my hope is that you will be able to:

1. Perform operating system tasks that are typically viewed as “power user” activities.
2. Implement common operating system functionalities and algorithms.
3. Demonstrate genre literacy within the operating system field.
